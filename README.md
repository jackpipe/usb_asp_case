# usb_asp_case
A case for LC Studio USBasp Arduino programmers, in FreeCAD.
Derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:121915

My first foray into FreeCAD, so not optimal.

Reversed .stl files into FreeCAD, splitting into two parts.
Added extra "ports" for the additional pins that the LC Studio version of the USBasp offers.
Increased the height of the top part, and added a slight pocket for the crystal, which was preventing flush fitting.
